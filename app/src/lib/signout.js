/*
 * Signing out of this device.
 *
 * The training log lives on the device as well as the server (lib/store.js keeps
 * a cache and an offline outbox in localStorage, and the service worker caches
 * the plan), so signing out has to take it off the device, or the next person to
 * open the browser reads it without a password. In order:
 *
 *   0. FREEZE. A `bushido:signingOut` marker (and a BroadcastChannel message)
 *      stops every tab writing the log to storage, so what is read next is
 *      everything this device holds. Lifted again if sign-out does not happen;
 *      a freeze older than two minutes (a tab that died mid-sign-out) is ignored.
 *   1. FLUSH. Push every local entry; the server merges newest-wins, so pushing
 *      all of them is safe. Then count what the server still does not have.
 *   2. ASK, only if something would be lost: say how many entries (or that the
 *      server could not be reached), and stop if the answer is no.
 *   3. RETIRE this device's push subscription (the service worker's
 *      PushSubscription: removed on the server by endpoint, then unsubscribed in
 *      the browser), so a signed-out device stops receiving the log's
 *      notifications. Done while the session is still valid, and best effort:
 *      an error or a slow answer never blocks the sign-out.
 *   4. SIGN OUT on the server, which revokes every session and sends
 *      Clear-Site-Data: "cache". Only a 2xx (or a 401: already signed out)
 *      counts. If the server did not confirm, the session is still valid and
 *      clearing the device would gain nothing, so nothing is cleared and the
 *      caller offers a retry.
 *   5. MARK every tab signed out (a `bushido:signedOut` key, plus a
 *      BroadcastChannel message), so another tab's sync landing late cannot
 *      write the log back. The marker is removed on the next signed-in load.
 *   6. CLEAR this app's localStorage/sessionStorage keys, any IndexedDB database,
 *      and every Cache Storage cache except the app shell (index.html and the
 *      built assets; never /api).
 *
 * Proxy mode has no sign-out, so none of this runs there.
 *
 * Every browser API is passed in, so the tests run it under Node.
